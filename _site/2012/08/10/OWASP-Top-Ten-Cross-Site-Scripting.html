        <h2>OWASP Top Ten: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>

<p><div class="byline">

</div></p>

<p>If you're a web application developer in this day and age and you haven't at least heard
about cross-site scripting ("XSS" for the lazy), you've probably been living under a rock.
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are one of the most wide spread web app attacks
that happen every day. They can also cause some of the worst troubles - tricking your
users with modified links, injected content or even pull information from the user's 
browser without them knowing.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is easy to overlook unless you're specifically looking to take care
of it, unfortunately, but it's prevention is key to keeping you and your app safe.</p>

<p>Lets look at the most basic of examples - this is one you'll find in 99.99% percent of 
the XSS tutorials out there (about PHP at least), but it's a good simple example:</p>

<p><pre class="code">&lt;?php
$_GET['test'] = "&lt;script&gt;alert('injection, yo!')&lt;/script&gt;";
echo $_GET['test'];
?&gt;</pre></p>

<p>Go ahead, try runing this one in a sample script - you'll see the problem immediately. 
In this example the value for <code>$_GET['test']</code> is hard-coded, but it could have just as
easily come in from the URL. This is where the problem <em>really is</em> - developers get lulled 
into a false sense of security and think "oh, the only things coming in are what I expect"
and they don't try to protect themselves.</p>

<p>So, how can you protect your site from this menace and rest a little easier at night? Well,
thankfuly PHP gives you a few different options to help get rid of the things that go
bump in the right like <a href="http://php.net/strip_tags">strip_tags</a> and 
<a href="http://php.net/htmlspecialchars">htmlspecialchars</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to focus on the second of these, <a href="http://php.net/htmlspecialchars">htmlspecialchars</a>
because of a handy feature that will come in a bit later to help keep you even a bit safer.
This function takes the string you give it and converts all of the special characters that it finds
(the non-alphanumeric ones) into their corresponding HTML encoded versions. Since the key
to this kind of attack is in the unfiltered output of a user string that could contain markup,
it essentially removes most issues that could be XSS related.</p>
